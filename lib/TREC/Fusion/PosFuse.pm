=head1 NAME

TREC::Fusion::PosFuse - A module to perform data fusion using the SlideFuse algorithm

=head1 METHODS

=over 4

=item new($qrel)

Create a new TREC::Fusion::PosFuse object. $qrel can either be the path to the qrel file or a TREC::QRelFile object. This is necessary for training purposes.

=item train(@result_sets)

Use @result_sets as training data. The number of result sets passed to this method MUST be the same each time, and result sets from different systems must be in the same order each time.

=item fuse(@result_sets)

Fuse @result_sets using the PosFuse algorithm. If no training has taken place, an error will occur. Similar to the train() method, the same number of result sets must be passed each time and in the same order. Once fuse() is called once, no more training can be done. Returns a TREC::ResultSet object.
