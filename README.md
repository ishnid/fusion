# fusion
Implementations of Data Fusion algorithms for Information Retrieval.

This repository contains implementations (in Perl 5) of the following algorithms, of which I am an original co-author:

* ProbFuse
* SlideFuse
* MAPFuse

It also offers some implementations of other fusion algorithms.

All are intended to work with topfiles and qrels offered by [TREC](http://trec.nist.gov).

Documentation is a little sketchy: questions by email to < dave /at/ lill /dot/ is >.
